### 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4

思路：没啥可说的，题目是medium难度的，这也太简单了...部分逆序对找这个数字的下标没影响，除非找的是部分逆序前的位置
```java
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
       int index = -1;
        for (int i = 0;i<nums.length;i++){
            if (nums[i]==target){
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
```
